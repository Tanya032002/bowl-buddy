# Project Guidelines

This README file outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## Fork the Repository

Each collaborator should fork the main repository to their own GitHub account.

## Clone the Repository

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

git clone [repository-url]

## Create a Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the feature or bug you are working on.

git checkout -b [branch-name]


## Make Changes and Commit

Make the necessary changes to the project in your branch. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.

git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

## Sync with the Main Repository

Before pushing your changes, synchronize your fork with the main repository to incorporate any updates made by other collaborators.

git remote add upstream [main-repository-url]
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

## Resolve Conflicts

If there are any conflicts during the merge process, resolve them locally in your branch.

## Push Changes

Once your branch is up to date with the main repository and any conflicts are resolved, push your changes to your forked repository.
